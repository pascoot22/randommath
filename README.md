# randommath

Respoitory for a bunch of python scripts I write to help me solve random math problems I come up with or find.

Also a fun crytogrogphy script for running a one time pad algorithm and a game to try and beat the encoder I wrote.

numguess is a number guessing game where you guess a three digit number, where you will be told how many numbers are corect/in the right spot, but not what they are, and try to solve it in 8 guesses.
